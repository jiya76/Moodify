## Introduction:
Our project MOODIFY is based on the idea of automating the interaction between the music player and its user by using openCV and other python libraries as humans have a tendency to listen to music in accordance to their mood. So our project would be helpful as it is “smart enough” to sort-out the music based on the current state of emotion the person is having.

## Table of Contents:
The two main parts of this project are to determine the emotion of the user using a front-camera/webcam and then sort out the current playlist based on that emotion. It is developed in such a way that it can analyze the image properties and determine the mood of the user and the unique feature in our application is that we can make our own queue, and play songs randomly other than mood based.
